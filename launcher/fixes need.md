### 1. access.py - ACCESS CONTROL DIALOG
**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

#### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Form Design Problem** (Lines 694-695)
   - All form fields in single vertical layout without logical grouping
   - Overwhelming for users, increases error rates
   - Directly matches UX report findings on form design

2. **Generic Error Messages** (Lines 880-883)
   - Error: `"Failed to register solution [{app_name}]"`
   - No actionable guidance for users
   - Increases support requests

3. **Artificial Loading Delays** (Lines 236-261)
   - Fixed `time.sleep(2)` calls make app feel slow
   - Time-based rather than task-based progress

4. **Inconsistent UI Elements**
   - Button placement varies throughout dialog
   - No standardized sizing or spacing

#### Specific Recommendations:

**HIGH PRIORITY - Week 1:**
```python
# Current problematic code (lines 694-695):
for field in FIELDS:
    add_layout.addLayout(self.app_filled_widget(field))

# Recommended grouped approach:
sections = {
    "Basic Information": ["Solution_Name", "Description", "Version_Number"],
    "Technical Details": ["ApplicationExePath", "TechnologyUsed"],
    "Business Information": ["Line_of_Business", "AAMI_Lead_ID"],
    "Release Information": ["Release_Date", "Status"]
}
```

**Error Message Enhancement:**
```python
# Replace generic messages with specific ones:
# Current: "Failed to register solution"
# Better: "Registration failed: Application name already exists. Please choose a different name or update the existing application."
```

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - Week 2:**
- Remove `time.sleep()` calls and implement task-based progress
- Standardize button sizes: `setFixedWidth(140)` consistently
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S for save, Ctrl+N for new)

### 2. launcherui.py - MAIN APPLICATION WINDOW
**Status:** 🔧 ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

#### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Monolithic File Structure**
   - File too large to read completely (>2000 lines estimated)
   - Poor component separation
   - Difficult to maintain and debug

2. **Fixed Layout Design**
   - Hard-coded window size: `setFixedSize(1200, 720)`
   - Poor responsiveness on different screen sizes
   - No flexible layouts

3. **Mixed Navigation Patterns**
   - Inconsistent UI patterns throughout application
   - Search functionality lacks real-time feedback

#### Specific Recommendations:

**HIGH PRIORITY - Week 3-4:**
```python
# Break down into separate components:
# - ApplicationGrid.py
# - SearchBar.py  
# - Sidebar.py
# - ApplicationTile.py (already partially separated)
# - MainWindow.py (coordinator)
```

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - Month 2:**
- Replace fixed sizes with flexible layouts
- Implement consistent navigation patterns
- Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys for grid, Enter to launch)
- Add real-time search with filter chips
