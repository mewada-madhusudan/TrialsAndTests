Process a document containing 60 pages. For each page, perform the following steps:

1. **Identify Image Content:** Detect and extract all text embedded within any images present on the page.
2. **Recognize Editable Text:** Identify and extract any text that is already in an editable format on the page.
3. **Order Output:** Present the extracted text for each page sequentially. Within each page's output, first provide the text obtained from the images, followed immediately by the editable text present on that same page.
4. **Page Separation:** Clearly demarcate the extracted text for each of the 60 pages in the output. For example, you could use "--- Page [Page Number] ---" before the text extracted from each page.

The final output should be a single text file or a structured data format where the text from each page is clearly identifiable, with the image-derived text preceding the editable text for that specific page.
